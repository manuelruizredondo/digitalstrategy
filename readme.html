# Sassy Starter [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/minamarkham/sassy-starter.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/minamarkham/sassy-starter)

A starter toolkit based on [Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS](http://smacss.com/) (SMACSS) and [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) for [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS) projects. Do what you'd like with it :)

Styles are broken down into the following groups: **Base, Layout, Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, States, Themes, Utilities and Overrides**

## Getting Started

1. If needed, [install](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm) `node` and `npm` (Node Package Manager).
- If needed, install `gulp` with `npm install gulp -g`.
- Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/minamarkham/sassy-starter` or download the zip.
- In terminal, `cd` to the folder containing your project. Alternatively, you can type `cd ` and drag the location of the folder into your terminal and hit enter (on Macs).
- In terminal, type `npm install`. If (and _only_ if) `npm install` isn't working, try `sudo npm install`. This should install all [dependencies](#dependencies).
- In terminal, enter `gulp`.
- Your browser should open at `http://localhost:3000`. You can access this same page on any device on the same wifi network and they'll see whats on your screen. It'll even sync scrolls and clicks!
- Edit your code inside of the `src` folder.
- Your complied and minified css, html, and javascript files will be created and updated in `dist/`. Never edit files within the `dist/` folder, as it gets deleted frequently.
- Keep `gulp` running while you're making changes. When you want to stop the gulp task, hit `ctrl + C`.

_For theming: add separate file (theme.scss) in`src/scss/themes/`, override the default `$theme` variable, and run `gulp themes`._
